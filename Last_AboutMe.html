        <p> The future of technology is in the field of robotics and Artificial 
        Intelligence. Everything I have done for the past 2 years is because of 
        my passion for furthering the reach of technology to new heights. As an 
        adult, I plan in pursuing a career in robotics with the goal of helping 
        developing countries with robotics. This career choice is ideal for me 
        because of the traits that I possess and the skills that I have 
        developed. I am a talkative people person who has positive interactions 
        with everyone. I am also very experienced in the field of robotics.  
 
     
        </p>
        My strengths and personal qualities play into my love for robotics. 
        Engineering is mostly a group activity where everyoneâ€™s ideas and 
        opinions matter. In this group environment, I thrive because of my good 
        intrapersonal skills. In a robotics competition that I participated in, 
        I worked with a partner to succeed in the challenge. Instead of leading 
        the project entirely, I set equal roles and advocated for complete 
        creative freedom. In the end, our plan won the initial challenge and 
        also won an award for creativity. This creative aspect of my personality 
        is born for my love of presentation. I have participated in many 
        performances and have won a regional competition that combined acting 
        and engineering.
        </p>
        Throughout high school, I have worked on many projects and participated 
        in many competitions. In school, I worked on an HTML portfolio, a 
        Scratch Game, and an MIT App Inventor App. By myself, I have worked on 
        an Addiction preventing Pill Bottle and have developed a mastery in 
        python. In a science fair, my group won second place for a contraction 
        that used electrodialysis to filter salt out of the water. Because of my 
        experience in a group setting, I can fit into any group with a smooth 
        transition. I have experience as a science museum explainer and intern. 
        I have learned to adapt to any situation and make the best of any 
        experience. 
        </p>
        The experiences of my life tie into my love for robotics and helping 
        people. Experiences like being an intern/manager at a museum have 
        improved my people skills. Different robotics competition has given me 
        the experience and knowledge necessary to be successful in the field of 
        robotics. Thank you for reading this brief summary of my life and have 
        fun looking at the rest of this webpage.
